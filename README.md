This is the small javaFX app for encryption, decryption  
app with Caesar Cypher. So it has a GUI, so you can enter file's path and choose action.
You have to enter full path to the file and new files will be created
at the same directory, but will have actions in their names like data[ENCRYPTION].txt

Also you can  run app from the console your command have to look like that
java --module-path %JAVA_FX_SDK% --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar "Full path to file" [Command name] "path/to/file.txt" "your_key"

But you have to install java and java fx sdk.
